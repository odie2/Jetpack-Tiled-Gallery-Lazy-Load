A simple plugin that uses jQuery Lazy Load to lazily load all images in galleries. Compatible with and designed specifically for Jetpack's Tiled Galleries.

A simple proof of concept implementation to play around with.

This plugin uses the jQuery Lazy Load plugin by Mika Tuupola (https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/), and is based on the Lazy Load plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/) written by the WordPress.com VIP team at Automattic, the TechCrunch 2011 Redesign team, and Jake Goldman (10up LLC).
